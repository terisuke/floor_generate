# Testing Results for End-to-End Pipeline

## Environment Setup
- Successfully set up Python 3.11 environment according to README.md instructions
- Installed all required system dependencies
- Created virtual environment and installed Python packages

## Dependency Issues
Tested multiple package version combinations:
- diffusers 0.21.4 + huggingface-hub 0.13.2 + transformers 4.36.0
- diffusers 0.21.4 + huggingface-hub 0.32.0 + transformers 4.30.0

Both combinations resulted in the same error:
```
RuntimeError: Failed to import diffusers.pipelines.stable_diffusion.pipeline_stable_diffusion because of the following error:
module 'huggingface_hub.constants' has no attribute 'HF_HUB_CACHE'
```

## Root Cause Analysis
The error occurs in the StableDiffusionPipeline initialization in lora_trainer.py when attempting to load the "CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4" model. This appears to be a compatibility issue between the huggingface-hub, diffusers, and transformers packages.

## Next Steps
1. Further investigate compatible package versions
2. Consider modifying the code to handle version differences
3. Document findings in PR #5
